# Temperature-Conversion-app
## The app allows the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions.
## User the following formulae for conversion
°F = °C x 9/5 + 32   and °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
## The initial temperature value should be entered by the user. 
## Pressing a Convert button should calculate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. Converted values should be displayed out to 2 decimal places only.
## The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history”:
# Example:
F to C: 55.0  => 12.8
C to F: 3.5 =>  38.3
## The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.
